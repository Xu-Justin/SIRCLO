# [Data Structure - Shopping Cart](https://gist.github.com/fandywie/12323549d2f8c202853018118b6054a7)

In this problems, I use python dictionary (equals to hash map) to store `KodeProduk` as the key. Therefore, the method `tambahProduk()` and `hapusProduk` has amortized time complexity of O(1). While, the method `tampilkanCart` has time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of `Produk`.
